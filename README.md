# Better Browsing
Some websites have become a little irritating, particularly if you don't live life logged in to everything on all devices.

Here are some scripts I use to restore a little web spirit and remember the days when clicking a link was enough.

## UserCSS
The following require [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) a browser addon for overriding webpage CSS using [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss).
* [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) (desktop or android device)
* [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (desktop only)

## Scripts

### [Reddit, hide all the 'appverts'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibrahn/better-browsing/master/usercss/reddit-no-appvert.user.css)
Reddit mobile doesn't seem to want to be a website any more. Hassles you about the app in up to five ways at once.  
This should hide them all.

---------------------------------------

### [Twitter, hide fullscreen nagging](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibrahn/better-browsing/master/usercss/twitter-mobile-no-login.user.css)
Twitter also seems uncomfortable with the idea of being a website.  
This tries to hide the fullscreen popups on mobile, about logging in and downloading the app.  
Also hides the top bar, because why would we need a search bar right under our search bar?
