# Better Browsing
A couple of scripts for people who don't like to log in or start a different app to read some text.

## UserCSS
The following scripts use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
a browser addon for overriding webpage CSS using [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss).
* [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) (desktop or android device)
* [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (desktop only)

## The Scripts

### [reddit-noapp-mob](usercss/reddit-noapp-mod.user.css)
* [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibrahn/better-browsing/master/usercss/reddit-noapp-mob.user.css)  
Reddit mobile doesn't seem to want to be a website any more and hassles you about the app in up to five places at once.  
This should hide them all.

### [twitter-nologin-mob](usercss/twitter-nologin-mob.user.css)
* [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibrahn/better-browsing/master/usercss/twitter-nologin-mob.user.css)  
A friendlier Twitter mobile for people who aren't logged in.  
Hides a lot of noisy interface you can't really use.  
Also hides the nagging fullscreen popups about downloading the app or logging in.
